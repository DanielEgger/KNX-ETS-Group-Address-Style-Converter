# KNX/ETS Group Address Style Converter

The KNX/ETS Group Address Style Converter allows you to convert group addresses of a certain style into another style. This can be usefull when dealing with software that can only handle a specific style of group addresses.
The supported address styles are: 3-level, 2-level, free-level, and binary. (More information on the different group address styles supported by KNX and the ETS software can be found on the corresponding websites.)

To use the converter, simply put the group address you want to convert (base address) in the colored cell of the corresponding section and all other styles will automatically be calculated.
For a more convenient use, all cells which should not be modified have been locked to prevent data entry in false cells. (You can always unlock the sheet if you want to edit the formulas. No password has been set.)
